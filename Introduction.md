# Olympic-Games-Dashboard
This data analysis project focuses on the Olympic Games, examining the number of competitors and medals awarded in each edition of the event. The project was conducted using a variety of tools and techniques, including SQL Server for data transformation and Power BI for visualization.

Before building the Power BI dashboard, I used SQL Server to perform data transformations on the Olympic Games dataset. This involved cleaning and filtering the data to ensure accuracy and consistency, as well as preparing it for use in Power BI. Once the data was transformed, I built a Power BI dashboard to visualize the data and identify insights.

During this analysis, I investigated the number of athletes who participated in each edition of the Olympics, as well as the number of medals awarded in different sports and disciplines. I also examined the top-performing countries and individual athletes in the history of the games. By studying this data, I was able to identify several interesting trends and patterns, including changes in the number of sports and disciplines over time, the emergence of new countries as top performers, and the dominance of certain athletes in specific events.

Overall, this analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the history and evolution of the Olympic Games, as well as valuable insights into athlete performance and country-level trends. The use of SQL Server and Power BI allowed for efficient data transformation and visualization, and these findings can be used to inform future Olympic planning and strategy, as well as inspire athletes and fans around the world.
