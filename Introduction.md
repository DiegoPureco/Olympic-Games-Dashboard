# Olympic-Games-Dashboard
This data analysis project focuses on the Olympic Games, examining the number of competitors and medals awarded in each edition of the event. The Olympic Games are the world's largest sporting event, with a rich history that dates back to ancient Greece. Over the years, the Olympics have grown in size and scope, with more countries and athletes competing than ever before. By analyzing the data on competitors and medals awarded, we can gain insights into how the Olympics have evolved over time, as well as identify trends and patterns in athlete performance.

During this analysis, I investigated the number of athletes who participated in each edition of the Olympics, as well as the number of medals awarded in different sports and disciplines. I also examined the top-performing countries and individual athletes in the history of the games. By studying this data, I was able to identify several interesting trends and patterns, including changes in the number of sports and disciplines over time, the emergence of new countries as top performers, and the dominance of certain athletes in specific events.

Overall, this analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the history and evolution of the Olympic Games, as well as valuable insights into athlete performance and country-level trends. These findings can be used to inform future Olympic planning and strategy, as well as inspire athletes and fans around the world.
